# enoch

A Clojure app designed to run my 'bot Enoch. My 'bot is a Raspberry Pi with a SB Components Motor-shield.

While this software is specific to this robot, you may find the motor-shield.clj namespace interesting as 
an example of how to implement motors, servos, and an ultrasonic sensor in Clojure using pi4j and 
sensorblast.
